# Comparative-Genomics
- Ten Helicobacter pylori isolates were sequenced as part of an outbreak analysis. SRA accessions are on NCBI for each: SRR1993270 SRR1993271 SRR1993272 SRR2984947 SRR2985018 SRR3214715 SRR3215024 SRR3215107 SRR3215123 SRR3215124
- Use all (10) SRA accessions above to fetch the Illumina sequence data from NCBI, and perform 1 of 2 options: parsnp or snippy approach to evaluate this small outbreak by determining which isolates were part of the outbreak and which are more distant, unrelated to the outbreak
